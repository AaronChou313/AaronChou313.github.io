## Coming Soon

We are actively working on several research projects and manuscripts that will be published soon. 
Our current research focuses on **collaborative localization and mapping for quadruped robots and UAVs** and we expect to have preprints and publications available in the near future.

Some of our works are currently in the drafting and review stages, and we'll be sharing them as they become available.
