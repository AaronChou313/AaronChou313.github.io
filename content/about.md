## About Me

Hi there! I'm Mingyang Zhou, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Spatial Information and Digital Technology at the School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering ([RSGIS](https://rsgis.whu.edu.cn/)), Wuhan University ([WHU](https://www.whu.edu.cn/)).

At present, I have been admitted to the Innovation Academy of Precision Measurement Science and Technology ([APM-CAS](https://apm.cas.cn/)), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/)) for graduate studies.

During my undergraduate studies, I learned spatial information-related web service development and application software development. I'm self-taught in C++, pygame, Unity, and Unreal Engine for game development.

In my spare time, I participated in robot-related competitions including [RoboMaster](https://www.robomaster.com/), [Raicom](https://www.raicom.com.cn/), China Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Competition ([CRAIC](http://www.caairobot.com/)), and China University Creative Robot Competition ([robotcontest](https://robotcontest2024.moocollege.com/)). Through the competition preparation process, I mastered skills in Ubuntu, ROS/ROS2, embedded development, electronics, mechanics, 3D modeling, and 3D printing.

Currently, I am working on my graduation project with [Prof. You Li](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/liyou1/zh_CN/index.htm) at the MOTION Research Group in the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing ([LIESMARS](https://liesmars.whu.edu.cn/)).
